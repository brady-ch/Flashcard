# Flashcard

This was made to be a functioning flashcard application.

## Made with:
- Bootstrap
- React
- Javascript
- HTML

## Purpose
This was made with the intent to further my understanding of React and React Hooks. Looking back there are a number of things I would change and would like to go back to change. I would refactor the code to optomize the API calls in the useEffect(). I would also make the forms that add and edit information in the server more modular, so that it would be more easily scalable and more easy to maintain.

## Goals
I need to go back and refactor the form to make it conform more to the single responsibility principle. It I would like to change it so not all of the forms are handled on that page so the project is more easily scalable.
